Installation
====

Use pip to install the package directly from its GitHub repository

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/hkneiding/HyDGL

which installs ``HyDGL`` as a library to your python installation or virtual environment.

Check that the installation was successful by running Python and importing the package:

>>> import HyDGL

.. note::

  A way to ``pip`` install via PyPI will become available soon.
