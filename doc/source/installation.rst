Installation
===

Use pip to install the package directly from its git repository

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/hkneiding/nbo2graph

which installs ``nbo2graph`` as a package to your python installation or virtual environment.

Check that the installation was successful by running ``Python`` and importing the package:

>>> import nbo2graph

.. note::

  A way to ``pip`` install via PyPI will become available soon.
